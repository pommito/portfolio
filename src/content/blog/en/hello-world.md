Welcome to my personal website, my name is Victor, I'm a freelance fullstack developer. On this blog, I will mainly share my learnings and experiences about web development. So to start this blog properly, here's some context.

## My Journey

I entered the world of web development during the last year of my master's degree in digital marketing as part of a work-study program. At that time, I really didn't enjoy my studies and had trouble finding meaning in what I was learning.

One day, I suggested to the company I was working for to set up a website. So I found myself with the mission of creating a website from scratch without any skills (_thanks YouTube_).

I really enjoyed this experience and decided, in the evenings after work and classes, to create other sites for clients.

> _A bit cheeky, we agree, but hey, you never know, it might work out!_

I found my first client in the comments of a Facebook post (_anything is possible_) and little by little, I started working for a few clients in the evenings and weekends. It was the first time I was paid to do something I enjoyed.

After my master's degree, I decided to invest in a 6-month web and mobile web developer training course that I took while continuing my missions for my clients. WordPress in no-code is good, understanding what happens behind the scenes is better.

Since this training, I've been working full-time as a freelancer on various projects that allow me to progress and constantly discover new things.

## That was long...

For those who took the time to read this article, (_bravo_) thank you. I will try to post articles regularly. Soon, I will publish an article that presents a simple way to do programmatic SEO with Astro and surely others about CSS tips with Tailwind.
